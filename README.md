# Cyclistic-_Data_Project
Google Data Analytics Certification Capstone Project

The Cyclistic Bike Share Program project is a data analysis project that aims to help Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, to increase ridership by better understanding how casual riders and annual members use the bikes differently. This project utilizes real-world data provided by Cyclistic and implements the entire data analysis process, from data cleaning and wrangling to exploratory data analysis and data visualization. Through the project, key insights and recommendations are generated to help Cyclistic optimize their marketing strategy and improve the user experience for both casual riders and annual members.
